# SimpleNoteServer
Very simple http based note server. Something I threw together because I wanted a 'global clipboard' of sorts for my home network.

This software is not secure or tested or bug free. It comes with no warranty. Use it at your own risk.

Was created for Python 2.7. Not tested with any other version of python. Because it uses SimpleHTTPServer, probably won't work in python 3 without some tweeking. 

To use this software run: "python SimpleNoteServer.py [ip] [port]" You can also leave off the arguments. See source for details.

Shouldn't have any external dependancies, unless your python installation is weird or something.
